## oh-my-pi 开发约定

### Default Context

This repo contains multiple packages, but **`packages/coding-agent/`** is the primary focus. Unless otherwise specified, assume work refers to this package.

**Terminology**: When the user says "agent" or asks "why is agent doing X", they mean the **coding-agent package implementation**, not you (the assistant). The coding-agent is a CLI tool — questions about its behavior refer to code in `packages/coding-agent/`, not your current session.

#### Package Structure

| Package                 | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/ai`           | Multi-provider LLM client with streaming support                                        |
| `packages/catalog`      | Model catalog: bundled models.json, provider descriptors, model identity/classification |
| `packages/agent`        | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management                                    |
| `packages/coding-agent` | Main CLI application (primary focus)                                                    |
| `packages/tui`          | Terminal UI library with differential rendering                                         |
| `packages/natives`      | Bindings for native text/image/grep operations                                          |
| `packages/stats`        | Local observability dashboard (`omp stats`)                                             |
| `packages/omptype`      | ArkType-compatible schema validation with a lazy JIT runtime                            |
| `packages/utils`        | Shared utilities (logger, streams, temp files)                                          |
| `crates/pi-natives`     | Rust crate for performance-critical text/grep ops                                       |

**Catalog import convention**: code in this repo imports catalog _values_ (bundled models, model-thinking helpers, identity, descriptors, model manager/cache) from `@oh-my-pi/pi-catalog/<module>` — never via `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`. The pi-ai barrel re-exports only the model/effort _types_ its own signatures use (`Model`, `Api`, `ThinkingConfig`, `Effort`, …); type-only imports of those from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` are fine.

### GitHub

- Before posting a GitHub comment or creating an issue, MUST show the target and proposed text and obtain user confirmation. An explicit instruction to post supplied text to a specified target already counts as confirmation.
- A request to address or fix PR feedback permits drafting replies, not posting them without confirmation. A request only to get or check comments is read-only.
- When authorized to resolve review feedback, MUST verify the fix, obtain approval for a factual reply citing the change and verification, and post it in the existing thread before resolving. NEVER resolve if the reply is unapproved or posting fails.
- Permission to work on a PR does not authorize unrelated comments or issue creation.

#### Pull requests

When authorized to create or edit a contributor-submitted PR, follow the checklist below. RoboOMP-managed PRs follow their dedicated workflow and enforced body format in `python/robomp/src/prompts/system_append.md` instead.

- MUST read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` first. Preserve the template sections and checklist, including when shortening an existing description.
- MUST obtain at least one sentence written by the contributor in their own words explaining what changed and why, as required by `CONTRIBUTING.md`. If it is missing, ask the contributor; NEVER generate a substitute. Preserve that sentence during edits.
- For user-facing changes, MUST follow the [Changelog](#changelog) attribution rules. Internal issue fixes keep their issue links. For external contributions, add the PR link and contributor credit after GitHub assigns the number, then push the entry before marking the changelog checklist item complete.
- MUST read back the published PR description after creating or editing it. Check only verified checklist items; explain skipped or inapplicable checks in `Testing`.

### Code Quality

- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **NEVER use `ReturnType<>`** — use the actual type name.
- **NEVER use inline imports** — no `await import()`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic type imports. Always top-level.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types instead of guessing.
- **Barrel exports**: prefer `export * from "./module"` over named re-exports, including `export type { ... } from`. In pure `index.ts` barrels, use star re-exports even for single-specifier cases. If stars create ambiguity, remove the redundant export path; do not keep duplicates.
- **Class privacy**: use ES `#private` fields; leave externally accessible members bare. **No `private`/`protected`/`public` keyword on fields or methods**, except on **constructor parameter properties** where TypeScript requires it (e.g. `constructor(private readonly session: ToolSession)`).
- **Promises**: use `Promise.withResolvers()` instead of `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)`.
- **Prompts**: never build prompts in code (no inline strings, template literals, or concatenation). Prompts live in static `.md` files; use Handlebars for dynamic content. Import them via `import content from "./prompt.md" with { type: "text" }` — not `readFile`.
- **Worker scripts**: workers re-enter the CLI entrypoint; never spawn separate worker entry modules. `cli.ts` declares itself as the worker host at startup (`declareWorkerHostEntry()` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/env`) and dispatches hidden argv selectors (`__omp_worker_stats_sync`, `__omp_worker_tab`, `__omp_worker_js_eval`, `__omp_worker_tiny_inference`) before loading the command registry. Spawn sites use:
  ```ts
  import { workerHostEntry } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  const hostEntry = workerHostEntry();
  const worker = hostEntry
  	? new Worker(hostEntry, { type: "module", argv: ["__omp_worker_<name>"] })
  	: new Worker(new URL("./<worker>.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
  ```
  When the process was started from the omp CLI — source `cli.ts`, npm-bundle `dist/cli.js`, or compiled binary — `workerHostEntry()` is `Bun.main` and the worker re-enters the single entry module, so no per-worker `--compile` entrypoints or bundle entries exist. Outside a CLI host (`bun test`, SDK embedding, standalone `omp-stats`) it returns `null` and the direct-module fallback loads the worker source. New worker kinds MUST add their selector to the dispatch table in `cli.ts` and keep the fallback branch.
  History: `with { type: "file" }` only copied the entry as a raw asset (workers crashed silently in compiled binaries — issues #1011, #1027), and the later literal-path + extra-entrypoint pattern required keeping spawn literals and two build scripts in sync (issue #1150). The smoke probe below is the live validation of this contract.
  Validate any new worker with the dedicated smoke probe: `omp --smoke-test` spawns the stats sync worker and the tiny-model subprocess, pings them, and exits — it's wired into `ci:test:smoke` and `scripts/install-tests/run-ci.sh` so binary, source-link, and tarball installs all exercise it. Add a sibling smoke if the new worker is on a different module graph.

### Central Utilities

Before writing a helper, check whether one already exists — `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui`, and the domain modules next to your callsite. This applies to **everything**: VCS wrappers, formatting/truncation/path-display helpers, image handling, clipboard, streams, temp files, caching. The central versions carry hardening a fresh copy always loses (timeouts, output caps, non-interactive env, lock avoidance, caching, TUI sanitization).

- Search first: `grep` for the operation before implementing it. Two implementations of the same thing is a bug even when both work.
- Examples of the pattern: `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives/vcs` and `src/utils/active-repo-context.ts` are the only sanctioned way to run git/jj (`import * as vcs from "@oh-my-pi/pi-natives/vcs"` — never hand-spawn via `$`/`Bun.spawn`); rendering goes through the helpers in TUI Sanitization below (`replaceTabs`, `truncateToWidth`, `shortenPath`, `PREVIEW_LIMITS`) rather than ad-hoc string math.
- Missing capability? Extend the central helper (new option, new sub-function on the namespace) and call it — don't fork its logic locally.

### Bun Over Node

Use Bun APIs where they provide a cleaner alternative; fall back to `node:*` only for what Bun doesn't cover. **Never spawn shell commands for operations with proper APIs** (e.g., don't `Bun.spawnSync(["mkdir", "-p", dir])` — use `mkdirSync`).

#### Quick reference

| Operation       | Use                                       | Not                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| File read/write | `Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()`               | `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`    |
| Spawn process   | `` $`cmd` ``, `Bun.spawn()`               | `child_process`                    |
| Sleep           | `Bun.sleep(ms)`                           | `setTimeout` promise               |
| Binary lookup   | `$which("git")` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils` | `spawnSync(["which", "git"])`      |
| HTTP server     | `Bun.serve()`                             | `http.createServer()`              |
| SQLite          | `bun:sqlite`                              | `better-sqlite3`                   |
| Hashing         | `Bun.hash()`, `Bun.password.*`, WebCrypto | `node:crypto`                      |
| Path resolution | `import.meta.dir`, `import.meta.path`     | `fileURLToPath` dance              |
| JSON5           | `Bun.JSON5.parse()` / `.stringify()`      | `json5` package                    |
| JSONL           | `Bun.JSONL.parse()` / `.parseChunk()`     | `text.split("\n").map(JSON.parse)` |
| String width    | `Bun.stringWidth()`                       | `get-east-asian-width`, custom     |
| Text wrapping   | `Bun.wrapAnsi()`                          | custom ANSI-aware wrappers         |

#### Process execution

Prefer Bun Shell (`` $`cmd` ``) for simple commands:

```typescript
import { $ } from "bun";

const result = await $`git status`.cwd(dir).quiet().nothrow();
if (result.exitCode === 0) {
	const text = result.text();
}

$`do-stuff ${tmpFile}`.quiet().nothrow(); // fire and forget
```

Methods: `.quiet()`, `.nothrow()`, `.text()`, `.cwd(path)`.

Use `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` only for: long-running processes (LSP, kernels), streaming stdin/stdout/stderr (SSE, JSON-RPC), or process control (signals, kill, complex lifecycle).

When using `pipe` mode, cast the stream:

```typescript
const child = Bun.spawn(["cmd"], { stdout: "pipe", stderr: "pipe" });
const reader = (child.stdout as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>).getReader();
```

#### Node module imports

Always use **namespace imports** for `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`:

```typescript
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
import * as path from "node:path";
import * as os from "node:os";
```

- Async-only file → `node:fs/promises`.
- Needs both sync and async → `node:fs`, then `fs.promises.xxx` for async.

#### File I/O

Prefer Bun:

```typescript
const text = await Bun.file(path).text();
const data = await Bun.file(path).json();
await Bun.write(path, data); // auto-creates parent dirs
```

Use `node:fs/promises` for directory ops (`fs.mkdir`, `fs.rm`, `fs.readdir`) — Bun has no native directory APIs. Avoid sync APIs in async flows; use sync only when forced by a synchronous interface.

**Anti-patterns:**

- `existsSync`/`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` in async code → `Bun.file()` APIs.
- `mkdir(dirname(path), …)` before `Bun.write(path, …)` → redundant; `Bun.write` handles it.
- `if (await file.exists()) { await file.json() }` → two syscalls plus race. Use try-catch with `isEnoent`:
  ```typescript
  import { isEnoent } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  try {
  	return await Bun.file(path).json();
  } catch (err) {
  	if (isEnoent(err)) return null;
  	throw err;
  }
  ```
- Multiple `Bun.file(path)` handles for the same path (including across `checkX`/`loadX` helpers).
- `Buffer.from(await Bun.file(x).arrayBuffer())` → `await fs.readFile(path)`.
- Existence check + try-catch around the same read → drop the existence check.

#### Streams

Prefer centralized helpers:

```typescript
import { readStream, readLines } from "./utils/stream";
const text = await readStream(child.stdout);
for await (const line of readLines(stream)) {
	/* ... */
}
```

Manual reader loops only when the protocol requires it (SSE, streaming JSON-RPC).

#### Misc

- **Sleep**: `await Bun.sleep(ms)`, never `new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))`.
- **Password hashing**: `Bun.password.hash(pw, "bcrypt")` / `Bun.password.verify(pw, hash)`.
- **String width**: `Bun.stringWidth(text, { countAnsiEscapeCodes?: false })`.
- **Wrapping**: `Bun.wrapAnsi(text, width, { wordWrap, hard, trim })`.

### Model/Provider Policy Lives in KDL

**NEVER hard-code model- or provider-conditional policy in TypeScript.** No `id.includes("claude")`, no model-name regexes, no per-model lookup tables (effort ladders, pricing, context windows, modalities, API routing, quirk flags). All of it belongs in the KDL rule tree at `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules/`, compiled by `bun run gen:compat` into the committed `rules.json` and resolved at build time via `resolveModelPolicy`/`buildModel`.

Ownership strata (see `src/compat/rules/README.md`):

- `taxonomy/*.kdl` — identity: class membership, families, revision extraction, reviewed overrides, suffix collapse.
- `classes/*.kdl` — model-lineage truths (behavior inherent to a model line, on any host).
- `providers/*.kdl` — deployment contracts (behavior a host imposes), plus documented exact-id residue.
- `runtime/behavior.kdl` — heuristics that run before/outside exact model lookup (`api-routes`, `model-limits`, `exclude-models`, `pricing-peer`, hosted defaults).

Rules for TS code:

- Branching on model identity in TS is allowed **only** through structured facts from `classifyModel()` (`class`/`family`/`revision`/effort facts) — never through string matching on ids, and prefer a KDL axis when one can express the policy.
- Discovery mappers map authoritative upstream fields as reported; seed neutral values only for fields the upstream omits or misreports **and** KDL explicitly owns via a correction axis (`input-modalities`, `cost-patch`, `limits-patch`, `context-window-floor`, thinking axes). Assert rule-owned corrections through `buildModel`; raw discovery specs remain the right assertion surface for parsing/normalization contracts.
- An id that no selector can isolate gets an exact-id `models` residue rule with a comment — never a special case in TS.
- Equal-rank rule overlaps throw `AmbiguousOverlapError` at resolve time; fix with an explicit `priority=` in KDL, not code.
- After editing rules: `bun run gen:compat` and commit `rules.json` alongside the `.kdl` change.

### Generated Files

**NEVER edit `packages/catalog/src/models.json` directly.** It is generated from upstream sources (stencil.so, provider catalog discovery, OpenCode docs) by `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts` and the descriptors/resolvers in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/`. Hand-edits get overwritten on the next regen. The same applies to `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules.json`, compiled from the KDL tree by `bun run gen:compat`.

To change an entry, fix the source:

- **Model/provider policy** (identity, thinking ladders, wire quirks, modality/limit/pricing corrections, API routing, roster exclusions) → the KDL tree in `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules/` (see the section above).
- **Provider catalog entries** (default model, discovery factory/flags) → the `CATALOG_PROVIDERS` table in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/descriptors.ts`.
- **Discovery/request plumbing** (endpoint shapes, auth, response parsing) → the mappers in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/openai-compat.ts`.
- **Generator wiring** (upstream merges, premium multipliers, post-processing order) → `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts`.

Regenerate with `bun run gen:compat` and/or `bun run gen:models` and commit the generated files alongside the source change. Add a regression test against the **rule/descriptor/mapper**, not the bundled JSON, so it survives upstream metadata shifts.

### Logging and CLI Output

Code that may run while the TUI, RPC, SDK, workers, or background runtimes are active MUST NOT use `console.log`/`error`/`warn`; it corrupts rendering or protocols. Use the centralized logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";

logger.error("MCP request failed", { url, method });
logger.warn("Theme file invalid, using fallback", { path });
logger.debug("LSP fallback triggered", { reason });
```

Logs go to `~/.omp/logs/omp.YYYY-MM-DD.log` with automatic rotation. Standalone CLI commands that exit without entering the TUI MAY use `console.*` or process streams for intentional user-facing output. Keep structured stdout clean. This exception is semantic, not filename-based; shared code must use `logger` or an explicit output sink.

### TUI Sanitization

All text displayed in tool renderers must be sanitized. Raw content (file contents, error messages, tool output) breaks terminal rendering: tabs → visual holes, long lines → overflow, paths → leak home directory.

**Rules:**

- **Tabs → spaces** via `replaceTabs()` (from `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` or `../tools/render-utils`).
- **Truncate** lines with `truncateToWidth()` / `ui.truncate()`. Use `TRUNCATE_LENGTHS` constants.
- **Shorten paths** with `shortenPath()` (replaces home with `~`).
- **Preview limits** from `PREVIEW_LIMITS`. No ad-hoc numbers.

**Apply to every render path**, not just the happy one:

- Success output (file previews, command output, search results).
- **Error messages** — these often embed file content (e.g., patch failure messages include unmatched lines). If a message contains file content, it needs `replaceTabs()`.
- Diff content (added and removed).
- Streaming previews.

#### Streaming tool previews

Tool-call previews can have **multiple render paths**. If you add preview-only fields or depend on partially streamed args, update every path — not only the final renderer. Streamed argument buffers decode into display args via `decodeStreamedToolArgs` / `ToolArgsRevealController` (`modes/controllers/tool-args-reveal.ts`); both the live event path and transcript rebuilds must go through them — never spread provider-parsed `arguments` next to a raw `__partialJson` (parsed args lag the stream by a throttled parse window).

For the bash tool specifically:

- The pending preview may need raw `partialJson`, not just parsed `arguments`. Parsed args lag until a JSON object closes, which makes inline env assignments appear only at the end.
- Preserve preview-only fields (e.g. `__partialJson`) through `event-controller.ts`, transcript rebuilds in `ui-helpers.ts`, and merged call/result rendering in `tool-execution.ts`. Missing one path causes inconsistent previews.
- `ToolExecutionComponent.#buildRenderContext()` for bash must work even before a result exists — the renderer uses call args plus render context to show the command preview while streaming.
- Verify both live streaming and rebuilt transcript paths after any bash preview change. A fix in one path does not fix the other.

### Commands

- NEVER commit unless asked.
- Never use `tsc`/`npx tsc` — always `bun check`.
- Never run `cargo test` directly for Rust tests — use `bun run test:rs`. It runs `cargo nextest run` (config: `.config/nextest.toml`) followed by a `cargo test --doc` pass, because nextest does not execute doctests. The doctest pass currently executes nothing (pi-natives is a `cdylib`, which rustdoc skips; pi-builtins' examples are `ignore`d vendored uutils docs) and exists so the first runnable doctest added to a lib crate is actually run.
- Merge commits (maintainer merges of PRs) follow: `Merge PR #<number>: <conventional PR subject> (@<author>)` — e.g. `Merge PR #6386: feat(catalog): add native Meta Model API provider (@eggpeat)`.
### Rust Build Profiles

Profiles live in the root `Cargo.toml`; `.cargo/config.toml` carries the settings Cargo.toml cannot express. Both are committed, so no local `~/.cargo/config.toml` is required.

| Profile | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | Default. Line tables for our crates, no debuginfo for deps, deps at `opt-level = 2`. |
| `release` | Shipping build: fat LTO, 1 codegen unit, stripped. |
| `local` | Fast local release iteration: thin LTO, 16 codegen units, incremental. |
| `profiling` | `release` codegen with symbols kept, for `perf`/`samply`/Instruments. |
| `ci` | Thin LTO, no debuginfo, stripped. |

**Never set `split-debuginfo = "off"` on a profile that has debuginfo.** On Mach-O the linker never merges DWARF into the executable — it writes a debug map (`N_OSO`) pointing at the `.o` files, and `"unpacked"` is what keeps those files. With `"off"` every backtrace frame in our own crates silently loses `file:line`; the `panicked at foo.rs:3` header still prints (that is `#[track_caller]`, not debuginfo), which makes the loss easy to miss. `ci` may use `"off"` only because it sets `debug = false`.

`embed-metadata = false` (in `.cargo/config.toml`) keeps crate metadata in `.rmeta` instead of duplicating it into every rlib — measured 196 MB → 130 MB on a reqwest-sized graph at identical build times. Its accepted spelling is toolchain-coupled; keep it in sync with `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Rejected, with measurements, so nobody re-litigates them: **sccache** (cannot cache incremental, bin, or proc-macro crates — measured slower than not using it), **mold** (ELF-only; no Mach-O support), and **`panic = "abort"` on `dev`** (Cargo ignores `panic` for the test profile, so the whole dep graph builds twice — 131 MB → 214 MB).

### Testing Guidance

Test the contract the system exposes — not the easiest internal detail to assert.

- Every new test must defend one **concrete, externally observable contract**: behavior, output shape, state transition, error mapping, or a regression-prone parsing boundary. If you cannot name the contract, do not add the test.

#### Good vs. bad test filter

- **Name the failure mode.** Every test MUST state what a consumer observes if it regresses. Cannot name one? NEVER add it.
- **Good: transformation.** One fixture MAY prove parse/render/normalize/encode/resolve behavior when output is computed, not echoed.
- **Good: branch or boundary.** Distinct inputs, empty values, malformed input, version/provider routing, and state transitions MUST prove distinct outcomes.
- **Good: external contract.** Exact bytes/shape MAY be asserted when a provider, parser, protocol, or persisted consumer reads them.
- **Good: precedence or negative contract.** Keep explicit `false`/override-wins assertions and required absence only when they prevent a documented leak, downgrade, 400, or incompatible wire field.
- **Good: regression.** A repro MUST trigger the prior real failure path and assert the corrected observable result.
- **Bad: static echo.** NEVER test a constructor/builder merely copied a fixture or baked constant into an in-memory config/metadata field.
- **Bad: success passthrough.** NEVER assert `fn(x) === x` when `x` was already supplied/declared valid; assert a transform, rejection, or downstream effect instead.
- **Bad: wording/defaults.** NEVER assert prompt/UI boilerplate, a default literal, object existence, non-empty output, or length growth without a consumer contract.
- **Bad: duplicate rows.** Parameterized/loop rows MUST each cover a distinct branch, provider/model path, or consumer contract; delete same-path duplicates.
- **Metadata exception.** Exact metadata, identity, ordering, or `undefined` MAY remain only when a downstream consumer depends on it and the test establishes branch, precedence, negative-contract, wire, or regression evidence.
- **Termination exception.** For cyclic/large inputs, assert a bounded output, surfaced error, or state change; bare `not.toThrow()` is insufficient.
- No placeholder tests, tautologies, or "the code ran" assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`, bare `not.toThrow()`, non-empty string checks, length-grew checks, "prompt exists" checks without semantic assertion).
- Prefer contract-level tests over implementation details. Avoid asserting internal helper wiring, field assignment, singleton identity, incidental ordering, prompt boilerplate, or passthrough option forwarding unless another component depends on that exact detail.
- Don't duplicate coverage across abstraction levels. If an integration test already proves the behavior, drop the narrower unit test that restates it through mocks.
- Tests **must be full-suite safe**, not just file-local safe. No long-lived file-wide mutations of `Bun.*`, `process.platform`, `process.env`, or `Bun.env` when a narrower seam exists. Prefer per-test `vi.spyOn(...)` with `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`. A test that passes alone but poisons later files is broken.
- **Never use `mock.module()`**. Bun's `mock.module()` mutates the global module registry and leaks across files ([oven-sh/bun#12823](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/12823)). Use `spyOn` on the imported module object instead. For pass deps, import the pass and spy on `.run`. For package deps, namespace-import and spy on the exported function.
- For lifecycle/stateful code, prefer one test per invariant or transition over several tiny tests asserting one field each from the same transition.
- For error handling, trigger the real failure path and assert the surfaced contract — don't instantiate error classes directly or inspect internal metadata.
- Smoke tests are acceptable only when they catch a failure mode narrower tests would miss. "Package boots" or "command starts" alone is not enough.
- Assert exact strings, ordering, and formatting only when downstream code parses or depends on the exact bytes. Otherwise assert semantic content.
- Compile-time guarantees → type checks/type tests, not runtime placeholders.
- **Never source-grep.** A test that reads an implementation file (`.ts`/`.rs`/build script) and asserts on its _text_ — `expect(src).toContain("someCall()")`, `.toMatch(/import .../)`, `.not.toContain("oldName")`, or "comment must say X" — is banned. It tests how code _looks_, not what it _does_: it breaks on harmless refactors (comment reflow, rename, import reorder) and passes while the behavior is broken. Assert the observable contract instead (run the code, check output/state/error), use the runtime smoke probe for wiring you cannot exercise in-process, and enforce structural invariants (no value-import of X, no self-import) with a type test or an oxlint rule — never a string scan of the source. (Reading a file your code _wrote_ — apply-patch result, generated bundle, temp fixture — and asserting on that output is fine; that is behavior, not a source grep.)
- Don't add tests for tiny low-risk changes unless they protect a real contract or fix a regression-prone edge case.
- Prefer focused package-local verification for the changed area.

### Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (per package).

**NEVER update changelogs unless explicitly asked.** Do not add, edit, or reorder entries as part of a feature, fix, or PR unless the user requests it.

**Format** — sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` (first if present)
- `### Added`
- `### Changed`
- `### Fixed`
- `### Removed`

**Rules:**

- New entries always go under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Entries are one line, brief, and user-facing: lead with what the user will see or can now do. Root-cause narration and implementation detail belong in the commit/PR, not the changelog.
- Never modify already-released sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`) — they are immutable.
- Don't flag changelog section order or formatting in reviews or PRs — `bun run release` runs `fix-changelogs` which normalizes everything automatically.

**Attribution:**

- Internal (from issues): `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/123))`.
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`.

### Releasing

1. Ensure all changes since last release are in each affected package's `[Unreleased]` section.
2. Run `bun run release`.

The script handles version bump, CHANGELOG finalization, commit, tag, publish, and adding new `[Unreleased]` sections.

## 发现处置纪律

自动检查（gate 的 `FAIL`/`WARN`、`jev` L3 语义发现、CRG / `ocr review` 审查意见）
产出的是**发现**，不是判决。每条发现都必须被显式处置，不存在"绕过"这个选项。

### 先读规范，再改代码

1. 拿到 finding，先读规则原文，确认这条发现到底要求什么：
   - gate 规则总览：`.githooks/GATE_HANDBOOK.md`（无则 `canon/manual/gate.md`）
   - 单条规则的参数（匹配范围 / 严重度 / harness）：`.githooks/spec/**/<rule>.yaml`
   - 项目适配说明（本仓为什么这么定）：`.agent/rules/gates.md`
2. 不确定 finding 是否成立时，读完规则仍不能判定 → **记为待裁决**并在交付记录里写明，
   不要凭猜测改代码，也不要直接忽略。

### 按根因修，不按症状修

- finding 指向的**约束**是根因。修代码使约束成立，而不是让检查不再报。
- 修完自问：这条约束在本仓还成立吗？下次同类改动还会不会触发？

### 完整读输出，不截断

- 拦截信息**逐条读完**再动手。`| head -5`、`| tail`、`grep -v` 会吞掉后面的 finding，
  让人误以为已经修完。
- 报告里出现「N checks passed」时，确认 N 覆盖了你改动的部分。

### 禁止糊弄式修复

以下动作一律视为违规（无论 gate 是否因此变绿）：

| 禁止 | 为什么 | 正确做法 |
|---|---|---|
| 改 `.githooks/spec/` 规则、降低 `fail_severity`、删 spec 文件 | 把约束改没，不是修问题 | 开 issue 说明规则缺陷，交维护者决定 |
| `--no-verify`、跳过钩子、直接推 | 绕过的是整个门禁体系 | 修到清零；规则有误走 issue |
| `head` / `tail` / `grep -v` 截断输出后当没看见 | 后面的 finding 被吞 | 完整读输出 |
| 加 `#[allow(dead_code)]` / `# noqa` 消告警 | 压制信号而非解决 | 删无用代码，或写清保留理由 |
| 建空文件 / 空目录 / 占位文件骗过目录类规则 | 结构噪音 | 真按规则合并或删除 |
| 给无断言测试塞 `assert!(true)` | 测试变成永真装饰 | 断言真实行为；无行为可测就删测试 |
| 拆分 / 改名 / 移动只为躲过匹配范围 | 破坏结构换绿灯 | 按规则设计的结构改 |

### 逐条处置并留下书面说明

- **每条 finding 一个处置**：修复（默认）或**书面驳回**。
- 修复 → 在交付记录里写：`规则 ID → 根因 → 改法（file:line）`。
- 驳回 → 必须写 `规则 ID + 不修理由 + 依据`，由维护者裁决。沉默即违规。
- 交付记录落点：PR 正文 `## Delivery record` 段，或 issue 的交付评论。
- WARN 与 FAIL 同等对待。WARN 只是不拦，不是可忽略。

### 规范层级

- `.githooks/` 是 gate 领地：agent 不改规则。
- `.agent/rules/`、`specs/rules/` 是规范正本：发现规则与现实冲突 → 提 issue，不自行改写。
- 本纪律与各仓既有条款冲突时，以本纪律为准（它更严格）。

## 代码风格

### 命名与结构

- 函数名动宾结构、见名知目的（`parse_channel_config` 而不是 `do_config`）。
- 公共 API 写文档注释（用途、参数、错误、示例），模块头写 `//!`。
- 变量与类型不缩写到看不出含义；短名只留给公认短物（`id`、`ctx`、`err`）。

### 注释

- 注释写**为什么**，不复述代码在做什么。
- 不留 AI 味注释（`// Step 1:` / `// This function` / `// 该函数…` / `// 首先…然后…`）。
- 需要解释的复杂逻辑，宁可提取成命名清晰的函数，也不要靠注释块描述流程。
- 注释掉的代码直接删；git 记得它。

### 占位符与未完成

- 未实现的函数或 trait 用语言原生宏，并带 issue 号：
  - Rust：`todo!("TODO(#123): 说明这里要做什么")` / `unimplemented!("…")`
- TODO / FIXME 注释必须带 issue 号：`// TODO(#123): …`。
- 不留空的 `todo!()` / `pass` / `NotImplemented` 桩而无说明。

### 复用与删除

- 动手前先找同仓同类实现与已装依赖。已有工具能解决就不新写。
- 新增依赖前确认：标准库能做完？已装依赖能做？确实都需要才加。
- **删除优于新增**：不留兼容垫片、旧别名、废弃分支、注释掉的旧实现。
- 改了接口就同步迁移所有调用方，不留双路径兼容。

### 工具

- 命名、缩进、格式化交给项目工具（`cargo fmt` / `gofmt` / `ruff format` / `prettier` / `biome`），
  不手工对齐，不在格式化工具之外争论风格。
- lint 报错逐条判断：真问题就修；误报就在规则允许的方式下局部豁免并写明理由，
  不整文件关掉。

## 构建与验证

### 基线

- 改动前先确认基线状态。基线已经红就先说清，别把自己的问题和既有问题混在一起报。

### 验证行为，不是验证代码存在

- 改完跑**真实命令**验证："跑一下" = 启动实际程序、调用实际接口、发真实请求、观察输出或状态。
- bug 修复先复现再修，修完确认复现路径不再触发。
- 永久性改动要留一个能抓住真实回归的检查。
- 测可观察行为与边界：状态迁移、转换、优先级、真实错误、边界值。
  不测 plumbing、不断言源码文本、不写永真断言、不测 mock 的回声。
- 测试与被测文件就近放 `tests/`（同名对应），保持全量套件可通过。

### 重命令放对位置

- 全量测试、全量构建、全量 lint 放 CI 或收尾阶段，不在改动过程中反复跑。
- 本地只跑轻量、快的针对性检查（单 crate `cargo check`、单包测试、`fmt --check`、
  类型检查）。
- 需要本地跑重命令时，套资源限制（`cpulimit -l 65 -i --` 或本仓等价手段），
  不抢占用户正在用的 CPU。
- 装依赖、打包等命令同样受限。

### 收尾

- 一次跑完该跑的检查（测试 + lint + 类型），不在半成品状态下宣称通过。
- 验证不了的部分（缺运行环境、缺凭据、缺硬件）明确说"未验证 + 为什么"，
  不把"没跑"说成"通过"。
- 不因为失败就改测试迎合实现。测试红了先判断是实现错还是测试错。

## 破坏性操作与敏感信息

### 删除

- 删文件前确认它确实是废弃物（生成物、已合并的临时文件），不是"看起来没用"。
- 用可恢复的方式删（`gio trash`），不用不可恢复的直接删除。
- `rm -rf`、覆盖写、清空数据库这类不可逆操作：**先说明影响，等确认**。
- 删的是别人的产物、你不理解用途的文件、或 gitignore 里的东西 → 停下来问。

### 敏感与不可逆

- 凭据、token、密钥、私钥：不打印到输出、不写进提交、不粘到 issue/PR 正文。
- 不擅自 dump 整个配置文件或环境变量（可能含密钥）。要看就只看需要的字段。
- 系统级配置、字体、全局环境、dotfiles 里的全局项：默认别动，改动前先问。
- 数据库迁移、配置格式变更、依赖大版本升级：先确认可回滚。

### 安装与全局改动

- 装包、改 PATH、装 systemd 服务、改 shell 配置：先确认再动。
- 写进 dotbot / 配置管理器托管范围的路径前，先确认该由谁管。
- 不可逆的系统级改动（分区、引导、网络栈）一律先问，不自行执行。

## 提交与 PR

### 分支

- 默认分支是 `main`（本仓若不同以本仓为准），功能从默认分支拉。
- 一个任务一个分支，分支名带类型前缀（`feat/` / `fix/` / `refactor/` / `chore/`）。
- 合并后清理已合并分支与 worktree，不留 stale 分支。

### Commit

- 标题走 conventional commit（`feat:` / `fix:` / `refactor:` / `docs:` / `chore:` /
  `test:` / `ci:` / `build:` / `perf:` / `style:` / `revert:`）。
- 标题**用英文**，正文可用中文。
- 一个 commit 一件事。不把无关改动、格式化噪声、生成物混进逻辑改动。
- 提交前跑对应检查（`gate pre-commit` / `gate pre-push`），不靠推送失败才发现。

### Issue

- 标题中文；正文 heading 英文、内容中文。
- sub-issue 必须自包含：正文不写 `Parent:` / `Related:` / PR 占位符，直接写清它要什么。
- 关闭前 `Done when` 的 checkbox 全勾。

### PR

- 标题纯英文（conventional commit 风格）；正文小节标题英文、内容中文。
- 正文按仓库模板（`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`）写：背景 / 改了什么 / 为什么 /
  实现步骤 / 交付记录 / 怎么验证 / 检查清单。
- 关联 issue 用 `Fixes #<n>` 收尾行；draft 阶段用 `Related #<n>`，合并授权前改 `Fixes`。
- 开启或更新 PR 后看 CI 结果到底（`gh pr checks`），红了就修，不等用户来问。
- 被 gate 拦下就修代码，**不改规则**。规则确有缺陷 → 开 issue 交维护者裁决。

### 收尾

- 收尾时清掉：已合并分支、临时 worktree、临时进程、跑完的 dev server。
- 资源及时释放；只保留维护者需要的进程（如用户要看的 web 前端）。

## 工具与命令

- 先用仓库已有的构建/测试/检查入口（`Makefile`、`justfile`、`package.json` scripts、`.githooks/hooks/`），不自己拼裸命令。
- 装依赖、跑重命令（长构建、全量测试、打包）前确认不会抢占用户正在用的资源。
- 长驻进程（dev server、watcher、调试器）用后台管理，不用一次性命令挂着。
- 破坏性操作（删除目录、系统级配置、凭据）先停下来说明影响，确认后再做。
- 命令跑不通时读完整输出，不要只看第一行就下结论。
